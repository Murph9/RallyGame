    // Drag gets worse as you drive (requiring more fuel)
    // - time to next checkpoint might decreas slowly

    // upgrade options are related to
    // - improving general performance 
    // - fuel economy
    // - buying fuel

    // After every 10x kms there are races which you must win, ie these are the boss milestones
    // or maybe just a mandatory fuel sacrifice
