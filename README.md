# RallyGame

Requires:
Java 8

A simple 3D rally like game in Java.
Can be played on my webpage at murph9.com under my games

Currently still very much in testing, you can drive around in many different car types. From normal cars, a 4x4, a track car, an impossible hyper-super-car and the infamous White Beast.

The world can be selected from a prebuilt selection of pre made worlds. Or you could be adventurous and pick the dynamic world type and have a selection of tracks generated in front of you.
