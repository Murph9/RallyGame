Currently still very much in testing, you can drive around in many different car types. From normal cars, a 4x4, a track car and an impossible hyper-super-car.

The world can be selected from a prebuilt selection of pre made worlds. Or you could be adventurous and pick the dynamic world type and have a selection of tracks generated in front of you.
